<p>The methods in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib_rellinks.rb</code> library may be useful for relativizing links more generally in HTML pages other than Jekyll sites.</p>

<p>It is extremely useful to have an offline version of a website that can work without an Internet connection or a local server, so it was quite surprising to find that a library to do this did not already exist.</p>

<p>This script has been used to create fully-functional offline versions of the <a href="https://globalstorybooks.net">Global Storybooks</a> websites.</p>
